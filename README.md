# StatusHub

StatusHub is a system for pushing and viewing log messages. Suppose you want to monitor a few long-running scripts with periodic output. With StatusHub, you can send all of their outputs to one global destination that you can check from any device.

For example, I train a lot of neural networks on various machines. Every minute or so, these networks compute a numerical "cost" indicating how well they are doing. With StatusHub, I can check on these networks from anywhere using the StatusHub web UI.

# TODO

 * Persist the log to a file
 * Android Wear application
 * Use a grid layout for the "Overview" page
 * Display log message dates
