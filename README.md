# statushub

This will be a system for pushing and viewing status messages. For example, I train a lot of neural networks on various machines. Every minute or so, these networks compute a numerical "cost" indicating how well they are doing. I'd like to be able to quickly check the latest costs of all my networks, either from my phone or from my watch.

# TODO

 * Persist the log to a file
 * Android Wear application
 * Use a grid layout for the "Overview" page
 * Display log message dates
 * Implement UI for empty log
